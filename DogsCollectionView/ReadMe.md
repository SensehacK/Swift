Accesso Project ReadMe

# Dogs Collection View


## Build

I haven’t utilized any specific library, so there won’t be any pod install or swift package manager dependency.
I opted out for installing third party library in order to keep things simple. I wanted to also utilize “Swift Lint” linter for better consistency.

You can run the app on Simulator.
Tested on:
MacOS 10.15.6
Xcode Version 12.3
Simulator 14.3



## Timeline

Thank you for the project assignment, it was great experience with evaluating candidates based off the actual job profile.

I’m including my project deliverable in a zip folder.
Attached in that folder has a ReadMe file for setting up the project.

The choice I went ahead for the project includes “Model View Controller” design pattern and also made sure to properly segregate specific data and code in different files for easy readability.

I did utilized Codable protocol

For specific functions I have included comments where it made sense.

Overall I believe the project consumed my 2 hours total in making sure it works as intended. 

Problems:

I would have worked more on the project but the 13inch MacBook Pro my friend lended me was an old 2014 - 15 laptop with very slow CPU & 128GB space.
Setting up Xcode took about 2 - 3 hours with my downloading speed and clearing some space in order to have Xcode installed.


Future features:
- I would love to implement a cache for images
- Proper auto layout for Nib files so that text and images height width gets dynamically rendered.
- Proper MVVM design pattern
- Maybe switched to Programmatic UI.



Please let me know if I need to submit anything more.

Thanks,
