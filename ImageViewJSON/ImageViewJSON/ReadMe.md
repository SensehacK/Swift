Netgear ReadMe

## Build

I haven’t utilized any specific library, so there won’t be any pod install or swift package manager dependency.
I opted out for installing third party library in order to keep things simple. I wanted to also utilize “Swift Lint” linter for better consistency.

You can run the app on Simulator.
Tested on:
MacOS 10.15.6
Xcode Version 12.3
Simulator 14.3



## Timeline

Thank you for the project assignment, it was great experience with evaluating candidates based off the actual job profile.

I’m including my project deliverable in a zip folder.
Attached in that folder has a ReadMe file for setting up the project.

The choice I went ahead for the project includes “Model View Controller” design pattern and also made sure to properly segregate specific data and code in different files for easy readability.

For specific functions I have included comments where it made sense.

Overall I believe the project consumed my 5 hours total in making sure it works as intended. Usually fixing certain bugs took most of my time for this assignment.

Please let me know if I need to submit anything more.

Thanks,
