# Sensehack Javascript

## Intro

This is just personal workspace for testing different functions related to Swift language.

I love to track my progress & git allows you to work around the problem statement by versioning it. So thats my inspiration for amalgamation of all of my other small code repository to a specific one stop solution repo for my local environment scratch pad.

## Content

Development Hell and most of Swift and Xcode quirks used with bit of documentation with small readme files along with my own documentation links of another repo I actively maintain for my own software developer growth.

Content would include :

- Swift Basics
- Swift different Frameworks
- Swift Tests
- Future plans
  [ ] SwiftUI
  [ ] Swift Package Manager
  [ ] Swift 5
  [ ] Health kit
  [ ] Notification

## Projects

Currently nothing is hosted to preview you would have to manually clone/download the project and build using respective instructions.

## Build

Clone the code and use Xcode v10+ to build the codebase.
Currently we haven’t added any packages to the build yet, if we do add those, you may need to do a quick

> pod install
> For installing all of the package dependency handled by Cocoapods or Swift Package manager.

## Develop

Install Swift Linter for proper code suggestions and we would also incorporate Unit tests as a way to be more compliant with Test driven development, even though this project isn’t designed and developed around TDD principles.
